# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for contributing! To start your contribution, please follow the steps below:

First, create a fork of this repo and `git clone` it on your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-user/your-fork.git
```

Use the `dev` branch, as commits targeting main will be ignored.

```sh
git checkout -b dev remotes/upstream/dev
```

Make changes as you want. When you're done, commit your changes:

```sh
git commit -m "brief explanation of the changes"
```

`Tip: You can setup code signing and add 0S to the commit command above to get a verified checkmark`

Then, push your changes:

```sh
git push
```

When you're ready, create a pull request on GitHub.
