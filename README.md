```

`🚧` Main UI

`🚧` Tauri Port <!-- Native C++ Desktop Port --> <!-- uhm not sure about what you mean with "native port" but i guess it should say "tauri" since that's what it says a few lines before, doesn't it?-->

`❌` Flashing Back-End

## Getting Started

Make sure you have NodeJS 14 or later installed, and either the `npm` or `pnpm` package manager- (being `pnpm` the recommended option).

pnpm run start
